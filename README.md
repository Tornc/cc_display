Simple physics sim, just wanted to experiment with sub-pixel rendering :P

### Note:
For subpixel rendering, I used exerro's method of getting the correct character. See here: https://github.com/exerro/ccgl/blob/master/src/functions/texture_subpixel_convert.lua.

Hopefully it's not seen as plagiarism ðŸ˜­.
